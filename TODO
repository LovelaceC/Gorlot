- Scene signals (on clean, on update, on draw, etcetera)
- Add primitive elements
- Elements added to the scene appear near the camera field of view
- Scale and rotate elements using their matrix
- Lights support
- Add tools (graphical, of course)
- Add support for materials
- Improve UI
- Scene elements UI tree
- Components (they can be added to elements)
- Assets
- Asset importing by dragging and dropping
- Asset manager
- Model loading
- Animation loading
- Animation blending
- C text editor in gorlot (they can be appended to the project, by basically compiling the developer C files with the game)
- Node editor based programming
- Node editor based material editor
- Project creation
- Project saving (using JSON?)
- Project loading
- Project manager (like that one thing in Unity)
- Multicamera support (change the BeginMode3D argument?)
- Element name
- Gorlot library abstraction (for files, sockets, threads, etcetera)
- Stop using extern variables
- Rename `editor/gui/' with `editor/ux' for the UX
- Clip the editor's scene editor (so only the part that has no overlapping UI is shown)
- When rotating and moving the camera in the editor capture the mouse
- Stop using constants in `editor/gui' create constants for sizes and that stuff
- Gui increases its size when resizing
- Element children
- Write the free camera mode myself
- If the mouse is on a nuklear window, don't let the camera move
- Isn't the GUI code so messy? Should I rewrite it?
- Geometry editor

- Sort this ToDo list (it is so deorganised)
